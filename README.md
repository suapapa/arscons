build & upload Arduino sketch on the command line with scons!

- Use Arduino IDE's conf. so, all board which supported by Arduino supported by arscons.
- Works on Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
- Need pyserial to triggering reset just before upload.

## Basic Usage:

- make a folder which have same name of the sketch (ex. Blink/ for Blink.pde)
- put the sketch and the SConstruct under the folder.
- to make the HEX do following in the folder:

    $ scons

- to upload the binary, do following in the folder:

    $ scons upload
